With the Fitness Tracker app users can create exercises and check out your stats!

## Installation
To install, you just need to download the files, go into your terminal and make sure you're in the right directory and you have node.js installed, then run 'npm i'. That should install all modules. Otherwise just check it out on heroku.

## Usage
Locally: In the same directory as the server.js file, type 'node server.js' in your terminal to run the program. Click "New Workout" to create a workout, after setting up all the fields you should be able to save it- then you can click on the dashboard button in the nav to see your stats. If on Heroku just follow the second half of these instructions.
